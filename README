To use this project you should first setup the repository for use:

./bin/seutp

Once the process is complete you can begin working on the software.

For ease of use there are two scripts in the bin folder that can help with compilation.

./bin/build - compile the software in Debug mode
./bin/release - compile the software in Release mode and create packages for the current platform.
